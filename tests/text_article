In bug 1630935 [1], I intend to deprecate support for drawing
stretched MathML operators using the STIXGeneral fonts with a use
counter, deprecation warning, and a pref to gate the feature (off by
default on nightly).

These fonts were a stopgap solution to a problem that has since been
addressed by OpenType MATH tables. Now that OpenType MATH fonts are
available, they=E2=80=99ve been deprecated upstream, and we=E2=80=99ve enco=
uraged the
ecosystem to switch since 2014 [2].

That support is now a special case in our codebase, causing
performance problems and making it difficult to refactor our MathML
operator stretching code, but we can=E2=80=99t unship without usage data,
because the fonts are still preinstalled on macOS.
