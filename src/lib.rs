//! ðŸ—ž Brokaw is an Usenet/NNTP client library
//!
//! # APIs
//!
//! Brokaw provides two primary APIs:
//!
//! 1. The [`NntpClient`] provides a higher-level that provides a a config based builder
//! and automatic deserialization of responses into different types.
//! 2. The [`NntpConnection`] provides a lower-level abstraction that only provides validation
//! that messages adhere to NNTP's wire format.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! Please check out the in-repo [README](https://github.com/sgg/brokaw) for examples.
